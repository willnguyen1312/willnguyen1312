### Hi there 👋

My name is Nam Nguyen. I am passionate about software development. I see how the Internet makes human life a better place - and I want to be part of the solution. I do my best to make my dreams come true. Life is all about challenging and pushing ourselves. My strong motivation has always been driving me toward innovation. My favorite quote is "Stay hungry, stay foolish" - Steve Jobs. I love learning and developing myself, never be afraid of failing because failure is a success yet not fulfilled. That's how I make my life count 💞

I have worked on several free open-source software with the mission to make the world a better place via quality software:

I have a personal blog [namnguyen.design](https://namnguyen.design) where I share my knowledge in software development and life experience

❤️❤️❤️ Be well, Be happy ❤️❤️❤️
